# Turtle Graphics Drawing Program

Welcome to the Turtle Drawing Project! Explore and create various designs using [Python's Turtle graphics](https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/) module.

## Introduction

This program allows users to interactively select and display different drawing patterns. It is designed to showcase the capabilities of Python's Turtle module, providing a fun way to create and visualize artistic designs programmatically.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

## Program Description

The program features five different drawing patterns:

- Star
- Spiral Design
- Rainbow Circles
- Fractal Tree
- Spirograph

Users can choose any of these designs from a menu, and the selected pattern will be drawn on the screen. After each drawing, users have the option to choose another design or exit the program.

## How the Code Works

- **Initialization**: The program sets up the Turtle screen and Turtle object.
- **Drawing Functions**: Each design has its own function that uses the Turtle object to draw the respective pattern.
- **User Interaction**: The program prompts the user to select a design from the menu.
- **Drawing Execution**: Based on the user's choice, the corresponding drawing function is executed.
- **Continued Interaction**: After each drawing, the program waits for the user to continue or exit.

## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to run the Coffee Shop Simulator Program:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
1. Download the code using the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/henrymbuguak/building-100-projects-in-100-days.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory `building-100-projects-in-100-days/10-turtle-drawing-patterns` where `main.py` is saved.
1. Run the program by executing the command:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

1. Follow the prompts to select a drawing.

## Example Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted with a menu to choose a drawing. Each drawing will be displayed on the screen using Turtle graphics. After each drawing, press Enter to continue or select another option.

User selects a star:

```shell
Choose a drawing to run:
1. Star
2. Spiral Design
3. Rainbow Circles
4. Fractal Tree
5. Spirograph
6. Exit

Enter the number of your choice: 1

```

This program offers a creative way to explore Python's Turtle graphics and experiment with different artistic patterns. Enjoy your drawing journey!
