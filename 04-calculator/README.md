# Python Calculator Program

## Introduction

Welcome to our Calculator Program! This simple yet powerful calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as square root calculations. This program demonstrates the use of Python functions and user input to perform these operations interactively.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

## Program Description

The Calculator Program includes functions to handle various arithmetic operations. The program prompts the user to input numbers and select the desired operation. It can also chain multiple operations, using the result of one calculation as the starting point for the next.

## How the Code Works

1. Functions: The program defines functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations.
1. Operation Dictionary: A dictionary maps operation symbols to the corresponding functions.
1. User Input: The program prompts the user to input numbers and select an operation.
1. Perform Operation: Based on user input, the program performs the selected operation and displays the result.
1. Chaining Operations: The user can perform additional operations using the previous result.
1. Restart Option: The user has the option to start a new calculation from the beginning.

## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to run the Calculator Program:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
1. Download the code using the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/henrymbuguak/building-100-projects-in-100-days.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory `building-100-projects-in-100-days/04-calculator` where `main.py` is saved.
1. Run the program by executing the command:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
1. Follow On-Screen Prompts: The program will prompt you to input numbers and select operations. Follow the instructions to perform calculations.

## Example Usage

Let's walk through an example where we calculate the square root of a number:

1. Start the program:

    ```yaml
    Enter the first number: 25
    Operations available:
    +   -   *   /   √
    Enter the operation you want to perform: √
    ```

1. Enter `√` for square root and press Enter.
1. The program calculates the square root:

    ```yaml
    The result of √25 is: 5.0
    ```
1. You can choose to perform another operation with this result or start over as prompted.

This example demonstrates how to use the Calculator Program to perform calculations interactively, including basic arithmetic operations and square root calculations.

Enjoy using the Calculator Program!
